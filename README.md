# Black-Holes-in-Massive-Gravity
Mathematica Code for my MSci Project on Black Holes in Massive Gravity

The solutions up to 8th order (the thesis only includes up to 6th because somehow I missed it.. :(  ) are in the text file 'Solutions of Integration Constants'

The most useful code file is 'Time Dependent BH Solutions Exerior.nb' which can be ran to find the sreies that constrain the integration constants. Importing the .mx file will Ã­mport the two series.
The 'Solving integration constants in Time dependent BH exterior.nb' file then computes the terms.
